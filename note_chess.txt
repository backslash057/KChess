we want to create a chess online platform where users can create accounts and play in different game modes

a player can create an account using a username and a password

-	when a user signs in using *Google*, we can store only his email and other credentials from google
 	he can create a password on his profile

-	when a user signs in *normally*, we don't store his email, he can set an email later on his profile

-	every player has a profile page with his credentials(email, username, Biography), stats(score), his old games history
	and his social links (optional)

-	A player can follow another player

players can play in 3 modes:
	against a friend (which he follows and is followed by)
	against a bot (pretrained)
	against another random player online
	
when a player wins a game in multiplayer, he wins some points

there is a global leaderboard where players scores from multiplayer games are ranked
this leaderboard can be filtered by countries (codingame like)

**GLOBAL
All the website pages should have the same menu and the same footer
the footer wil contains the copyright and the author(s) social networks


Note to myself:
THOSE ARE ALL FUNCTIONALITIES, DON'T ADD OTHER ONES IF YOU ARE NOT DONE CODING THESE
